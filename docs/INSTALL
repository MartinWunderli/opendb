OpenDb Installation Instructions
--------------------------------

1) Requirements

To install the Open Media Collectors Database (OpenDb) on your site, you 
will need the following:

- WebServer (Apache 1.3, 2.x, IIS,...) - Apache is recommended, but IIS should work too.

- PHP 4.3.0+, 5.X
  	* track_vars must be enabled.
	* register_globals can be enabled/disabled.
	* php-mysql module must be installed, so that PHP can access MySQL.
		
- MySQL Database 4.X, 5.X

- SMTP server or PHP email configured.  If this is not possible, be sure to 
set the email configuration Mailer to 'none'.

2) Installation / Upgrade

!!WARNING!! - Its extremely important to make a new directory for the 1.X installation
files, do not extract 1.X files over the top of your existing 0.81 installation.  There
is a very good chance that conflicts between the old and new files will occur and this
must be avoided.

The new installer introduced with OpenDb 1.X, is a more sophisticated mechanism for
upgrading / installing the OpenDb database.  It can be activated directly by executing 
install.php.

With appropriate credentials, the OpenDb installer can create the opendb database
and user.  The installer is fairly self-explanatary and in many cases, will 
automatically perform the appropriate upgrades without any further intervention.

The install.php should be removed from the root directory of the opendb installation once
the install / upgrade process is complete.

2.1) Cover Image Cache (upload/ directory)

When you upgrade from 0.81, if you have any locally saved cover images, you must copy the upload/
directory over to the new 1.X installation, so that cached images can continue to be served.
