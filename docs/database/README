OpenDB Database support
=======================

What's this ?
The aim of this is to be able to use any database type beside OpenDB.

How it works ?
The file functions/database/databaseabstract.php is responsible of redirecting to 
the right php database calls (eg: mysql_query(), pg_query(), ...).
So adding new database support could be much simpler.
In addition, when installing OpenDB for the first time, the database is populated of system data. 
This done by importing a SQL dumps. Those SQL dumps might be provided in install/new/[DBMS-NAME]/*.sql .

And what about non-regular SQL functions ?
Avoid using them !!! This is the cost of compatibility. However, a simple parser/rewriter can help by rewriting queries of functions.
It is possible to add SQL procedural functions too (check install/new/postgresql/tables.sql at the end of file).
